# Advanced SSL Pinning Bypass Tool ‚Äî v3.1

> A responsibly-framed toolkit description for authorized security teams and developers.  
> **Important:** This repository does **not** provide operational instructions to bypass protections. See **Safety & Legal** below.

---

## üö® Important Notice (Read First)

This project is intended **only** for:

- Authorized penetration testing (with written permission from the application owner)  
- Internal security audits within your own organization  
- Coordinated bug-bounty engagements where the application owner has consented

**Catatan:** alat ini hanya untuk authorized penetration testing, audit internal, atau kerja sama bug-bounty dengan pemilik aplikasi. Penyalahgunaan akan berakibat hukum ‚Äî jangan coba-coba.

Any unauthorized use, distribution, or application of techniques to bypass security controls is strictly prohibited. The maintainers of this repository will **not** assist or support illegal activity.

## About

Advanced SSL Pinning Bypass Tool v3.1 is a descriptive, responsibly-documented project that explains capabilities useful to security professionals who need to perform **legal and authorized** security assessments on Android applications. The goal of this repository is to:

- Describe common testing capabilities and risk-control features in a transparent way  
- Offer a framework for coordinating safe, documented testing activities with application owners  
- Provide policy, contribution, and disclosure guidance so companies and researchers can collaborate ethically

> This README intentionally avoids step-by-step exploit instructions or actionable code that could be used to bypass protections in production systems.

## High-level Features (Non-Operational)

> The list below explains the kinds of features a professional testing toolkit might offer. It is descriptive only ‚Äî no operational detail is provided here.

1. **APK Analysis & Metadata Reporting**  
   - Automated extraction of high-level metadata (target SDK, manifest entries, embedded native libraries) to inform assessment scope.

2. **Manifest & Network Policy Adjustment (Test Environments)**  
   - Tools to help prepare *test-environment* manifests or network-security configurations for controlled laboratory testing (not for production alteration).

3. **Bytecode / Smali Sanitization & Integrity Checks**  
   - Non-destructive validation checks and tooling to flag inconsistencies in decompiled artifacts and to help reduce accidental crashes during testing.

4. **Library Compatibility & Native Lib Checks**  
   - Detection of native libraries and compatibility flags with suggestions for safe handling in a test harness to avoid runtime failures.

5. **Client-Side HTTP/Networking Adaptation Support (Descriptive)**  
   - High-level support targets commonly-used HTTP stacks (e.g., OkHttp, Retrofit) to help researchers understand where client-side network protections are enforced.

6. **Certificate Simulation for Test Proxies (Controlled Use Only)**  
   - Support for generating temporary certificates for use **only in closed test labs** with devices under the tester‚Äôs control and with owner consent.

7. **Crash-Prevention Modes**  
   - Multiple testing modes (e.g., ‚ÄúSafe‚Äù, ‚ÄúBalanced‚Äù, ‚ÄúAggressive‚Äù) to help choose lower-risk approaches during narrow-scope, authorized evaluations.

8. **Repackaging Considerations (Testing-only)**  
   - Non-production mechanisms to repackage test artifacts for temporary lab deployment and debugging; always subject to policy and agreement.

9. **Reporting & Audit Trail Templates**  
   - Templates and recommended checklists for documenting scope, permissions, test steps, and findings to support responsible disclosure.

---

## Intended Use Cases

- Internal app security assessments where the organization owns the application and infrastructure.  
- Vendor or third-party audits conducted under explicit, written scope agreements.  
- Coordinated bug-bounty testing performed according to the program rules and with the application owner‚Äôs consent.  
- Educational demonstrations in a controlled classroom or lab environment, where all devices and apps are owned by the instructor.

## Safety, Legal & Ethical Requirements

Before any testing begins, ensure all of the following are completed:

1. **Written Authorization** ‚Äî A signed scope/consent form from the application owner that describes permitted targets and actions.  
2. **Test Plan** ‚Äî A short, clear plan describing objectives, risk mitigation, and rollback procedures.  
3. **Controlled Environment** ‚Äî Tests must run in isolated test labs or staging environments; production testing requires special approval and precautions.  
4. **Data Handling** ‚Äî No extraction of sensitive/production data. If any production data is involved, stop immediately and notify stakeholders.  
5. **Notification & Escalation** ‚Äî Contact points and incident escalation paths must be known in advance.  
6. **Reporting** ‚Äî All findings should be reported responsibly and promptly to the application owner following agreed timelines.

Failure to follow these rules can cause real harm and legal consequences.

## How to Request Access / Demo (Non-Technical)

If you represent a team that wants to evaluate this toolset in a legal and safe context, please:

1. Open an issue in this repository titled: `Request: Demo / Authorized Evaluation`  
2. Provide the following (high-level only ‚Äî do NOT share sensitive data in the issue):  
   - Organization name and contact email  
   - Proof of ownership or written authorization (summary)  
   - High-level scope desired (app/staging/dev only)  
   - Preferred time window for coordination

A maintainer or project contact will follow up to coordinate next steps and documentation templates.

## Contribution & Code of Conduct

Contributions that improve documentation, safety guidance, templates for authorization, and non-actionable analysis are welcome. We **do not** accept contributions that:

- Enable or automate production bypass of security controls  
- Provide scripts or step-by-step instructions for exploiting systems without consent

Please follow the repository‚Äôs `CONTRIBUTING.md` and the standard [Contributor Covenant Code of Conduct](https://www.contributor-covenant.org/).

---

## Reporting Vulnerabilities

If you discover a vulnerability in this repository or associated tooling, please report it privately:

- Open a private issue if available, or contact the maintainers at: `security@example.com` *(replace with real contact)*  
- Include reproducible steps only within a consented test environment and do **not** post exploit details publicly.

We will respond promptly and coordinate disclosure with you.

---

## Documentation & Templates Included

This repo contains (descriptive and non-operational):

- Risk assessment & authorization templates  
- Test-plan checklist (legal & safety items)  
- Reporting templates for findings and remediation recommendations  
- Non-actionable architecture notes on common client networking patterns  
- Changelog & release notes describing high-level changes

---

## License

This repository is licensed under the **MIT License** (see `LICENSE`). By contributing or using the documentation here you agree to follow the safety and legal guidelines contained in this README.

---

## Changelog (high level)

**v3.1** ‚Äî Enhanced crash prevention, improved native library diagnostics, clarified safety templates and reporting workflows.  
(See `CHANGELOG.md` for non-actionable notes.)

---

## Final Note

This README is written to help security teams and developers coordinate responsible, legal testing activities. If your goals are legitimate, we‚Äôll help you set up the paperwork and safe test plan ‚Äî but we will **not** provide or host operational exploit instructions for bypassing security controls in unauthorized contexts.

If you want, I can also help draft:

- A sample written authorization template (legal language + sign-off fields)  
- A short test-plan checklist for internal SOC teams  
- A CONTRIBUTING.md that enforces the non-actionable contribution policy
